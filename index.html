        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #b0bec5">
          <span class="drop-cap">É</span> is an interdisciplinary collective
          exploring the cooperation between nature and science through
          indigenous and innovative research.

          <h3>Our Values</h3>
          <p>
            Authenticity & Honesty, Aspiration & Determination, Receptiveness &
            Transparency, Care & Empathy, and most importantly, Sustainability &
            Ecological awareness guide our actions and strengthen both our
            personal connections and our responsibility to the world around us.

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Our mission is to bring together artists, innovators, and community
            members, anybody who believes in unconventional solutions, mutual
            support, and cultural resilience. We work to confront the challenges
            of pollution, consumerism, and the pressures of modern systems by
            creating a collaborative space where people can unite, take action,
            and shape a more sustainable and culturally empowered future.

          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <!-- <ul class="vision-list"> -->
          <p>
            Our vision is to make Sustainability & Awareness genuinely
            fashionable & essential. We were born into an industrial culture
            where simply participating often feels inherently harmful to the
            environment, which raises important questions: Does it have to be
            this way? Is ethical consumerism even possible? How do we move
            beyond greenwashing?
          </p>
          <p>
            As a collective, we explore unconventional approaches, often
            discovering they’re far more natural and intuitive than expected. We
            aim to question everything, from the way we live and breathe to the
            systems we’re told are necessary. And we want to inspire others to
            do the same, approaching this exploration with respect, curiosity,
            and a sense of radical love for ourselves, each other, and the
            planet.

          <h3>Our Goals</h3>
          <ul class="vision-list">
            <li>
              Building the financial foundation needed to create shared spaces,
              studios, and tools that empower creative work and community
              collaboration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Draw inspiration from indigenous knowledge and innovative
              practices, embracing slow living as a counterbalance to the
              pressures of modern culture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be committed to exploring "disart", nurturing curiosity, and
              supporting decentralised and interdisciplinary forms of art that
              challenge traditional structures and open new pathways for
              expression.

          <h3>Teladrutyun</h3>
          <p>
            "É collective" was founded by Mila Harutyunyan and Margarita
            Astvacatryan, two diverse visionary beings committed to challenging
            and pushing the boundaries of what is traditionally perceived as
            art. Having completed several interactive performances that blend
            experimental visuals and soundscapes, they are now expanding their
            horizons as a collective. With a strong sense of mission, "É
            collective" unites other bold and talented artists and friends from
            various other disciplines, creating a dynamic platform for
            experimentation and collaboration. Their work is driven by the
            desire to challenge conventions, explore new forms of artistic
            expression, systems and lifestyles.
